🧠 Quiz Game – Modular Python Trivia App
Ready to test your knowledge and have some fun while you're at it?
This Quiz Game is a command-line trivia app built in Python with a clean, modular architecture. It demonstrates object-oriented design, data handling, and a focus on code clarity. All wrapped in an engaging user experience.

This isn't just a quiz, it's a system design exercise disguised as fun. 😉

📁 Project Structure
Each file has a focused responsibility, inspired by real-world software design principles:

data.py
Contains a set of trivia questions stored as a list of dictionaries. Think of it as the trivia database for the game.

question_model.py
Defines the Question class, a simple data structure representing a single quiz question and its answer.

quiz_brain.py
The "brain" of the game. It manages question flow, checks answers, keeps score, and controls game progression.

main.py
The main application logic that initializes everything and runs the game loop. It ties all modules together to create an interactive CLI quiz experience.

🎯 Why This Project?
This project was a fun way to apply and reinforce:

✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

✅ Separation of Concerns & Clean Architecture

✅ Control Flow and Input Handling

✅ Data Abstraction and Logical State Management

It's also a great example of how to design small systems that are easy to read, test, and extend.
